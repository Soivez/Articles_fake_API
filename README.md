# Articles using Fake-API
This is a program that shows articles and their names using RecycleView. Here we use Room and Fake-API to remove and add new articles, first all changes are being 
written into the Room and to our Fake-API in case we have internet connection. There is a refresh button that downloads all articles from server and shows them.
Button right to each article deletes it, and saves changes to the room and our server.
